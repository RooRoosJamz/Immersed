## Immersed
#Immersed is a web application that provides an immersive style of cyber security training for kids to engage with real world cyber security threats, while educators/administrators can tailor the training content to their trainees. Immersed is an MVP and due to its properietary nature,  I can only provide snippets of my code. This includes .NET, SQL, and React code the components I worked on for Immersed.

My role as a Full Stack Software Engineer with Immersed is create the Rescue Center dashboard. The Resuce Center is dashboard where a trainee can go after they experienved a cyber security consequence in their training. 

I handled all the coding from backend to the frontend for this component of the site, as well helped my team with other sections of the site.
